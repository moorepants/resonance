    "# 2. Introducing Mechanical Vibrations By Investigating a Book Oscillating on a Cylindrical Cup\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces a single degree of freedom vibratory system of a textbook balancing on a cylindrical cup. The system is implemented as a model that students can interact with in order to visualize its free response and compare the computer simulation to a demonstration in the classroom.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "After the completion of this assignment students will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   load a specific system\n",
    "-   view and set parameters on a system\n",
    "-   create a visualization that depicts the system's configuration\n",
    "-   visualize a system's free response\n",
    "-   estimate the period of a sinusoidal vibration from a time series\n",
    "-   compare a computer simulation result to experimental result\n",
    "-   interactively adjust the book inertia to see the affect on system response\n",
    "-   understand the concept of natural frequency nd its relationship to mass/inertia\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are vibrations?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will study a simple vibratory system. A vibrating mechanical system is typically defined as a collection of rigid and flexible objects that interact in a closed envelope. If you set a cylindrical cup on its side and place a book lying flat on top of it, the book will oscillate if initially displaced at a small non-horizontal angle. Note that it oscillates about a horizontal position. This position is called an *equilibrium point*, *equilibrium state*, or *equilibrium configuration* which is a natural position the system comes to when there is no motion. Vibration is formally defined as an *oscillation about an equilibrium*.\n",
    "\n",
    "During this class we will examine and explore many different vibratory systems, such as this simple book on a cup system. We will have some live demos, as we are showing now, but in general we will work with computational representations of systems to experiment and learn about the nature of vibration. For example, here is a system that represents the book on a cup. To execute the following Jupyter code cell press the shift and enter key simultaneously:"

    "All systems will have different sets of constant parameters. This system could also have more parameters, for example what if you were on the moon?

    "There are are an infinite number of time varying parameters. Most systems are described by a uniquely simple set of time varying parameters, often called *generalized coordinates*. These coordinates define the configuration of the system. In our case the vertical and horizontal location of the book's mass center could uniquely describe the configuration of the system (if the book can't slip on the cup). But a better choice would be to use the single time varying angle of the books surface relative to horizontal to define the configuration. The angle of the book is thus a generalized coordinate because no fewer number of time varying parameters can possibly be used to describe the configuration. For simple systems, the number of generalized coordinates corresponds to the number of *degrees of [freedom]()* of a system. The degrees of freedom are the number of independent parameters that define the configuration. The non-slipping book on a cup has 1 degree of freedom which is described by the single generalized coordinate, the book's angle. The system's generalized coordinates can be accessed as such:"

    "Another type of time varying parameter that can be extracted from systems are non-generalized coordinates or other combinations of constant parameters. We will call these *measurement parameters*. For example, maybe you are interested in the vertical and horizontal location of the book's lower left corner. If you had an appropriate dynamics distance sensor you could measure this location as it changes with time. Or you can define how these two measurement parameters are a function of the book angle and the system's geometry. You can add measurement parameters to a system by defining a Python functions that compute the geometric relationship. Given the value of a generalized coordinate and the values of the system's constant parameters, we can define a function that computes the measurement parameter. These functions need to be to accept scalars and arrays, so import NumPy to make use of array aware functions like `cos()` and `sin()` :"

    "Now that we have a system with defined constant parameters we can make it vibrate. There are two ways to create this motion: apply perturbing forces to the system or set the coordinate to an initial angle other than the equilibrium angle. We will do the later here. The resulting motion is called the *free response* of the system, meaning that no external forces are causing the motion. To simulate the free response of the system, some values of time are needed. In this case an initial time value and a final time value are passed into the `free_response()` function. First, set the initial angle of the book and then call `free_repsonse)`, storing the result in a variable named `trajectories` :"
