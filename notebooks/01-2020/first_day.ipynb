Thinking about the book and the mug, it will oscillate if initially displaced at a small non-horizontal angle and let go. Note that it oscillates about a horizontal position. This position is called an **equilibrium point**, **equilibrium state**, or **equilibrium configuration** which is a natural position the system comes to when there is no motion. Vibration is formally defined as an **oscillation about an equilibrium** and occurs if there is a moving inertial object which has **restoring forces** acting on it.\n",
